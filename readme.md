# FrameThinker

This is the official repository for the core code of the paper: **FrameThinker: Learning to Think with Long Videos via Multi-Turn Frame Spotlighting**.

## 📖 About The Project

FrameThinker is a novel framework for long-video reasoning that challenges the inefficient, passive methods of traditional models. Instead of processing a fixed set of pre-sampled frames, FrameThinker **actively** interrogates video content through a **multi-turn, iterative process**. It intelligently spotlights relevant frame sequences to gather evidence, guided by a Cognitive Consistency Verification (CCV) module that ensures its reasoning is logical and interpretable. Across six challenging benchmarks, FrameThinker achieves an **average +10.4% accuracy improvement** over the baseline. As a highlight, it surpasses the strong LongVILA-R1 to set a new state-of-the-art on the LongVideo-Reason benchmark, using just 20.6 frames on average.
